Introduction
============
This implements a client-server Mazewar game. 
Additionally, the MSocket class can be used to 
induce errors, such as adding delays and reordering packets.


Architecture
============
The server starts and listens on some port.

When the client contacts the server, the server spawns a 
ServerListenerThread. 

When the expected number of clients have contacted the 
server, the server spawns a ServerSenderThreads, that sends 
the name and location of all other clients to all other clients.

The client communicates using MSockets.

MSockets have three important member objects, which consist of
a Socket, an ObjectInputStream, and an ObjectOutputStream

The MSocket can reorder packets and add delays based on 
2 constants.
